This repository demonstrates a common yet dangerous error in C programming: division by zero.  The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version with error handling.  Division by zero leads to undefined behavior, often resulting in program crashes or unpredictable outputs.  Proper error handling, such as checking for zero denominators before division, is crucial for robust applications.
